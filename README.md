# Juno Records (WIP)

## Motivation

This is a tribute for one of my favorite online record stores, [Juno Records](http://www.juno.co.uk).

I decided to challenge myself to reverse engineer their website with Next.js and without using 3rd party design libraries, only my CSS-styled-components skills.
